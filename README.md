# go-circleci

go-circleci is a Go library for accessing the [CircleCI API v2](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#circleci-api).

Currently, go-circleci requires Go version 1.14 or greater.

If you're interested in using the API v1, the recommended library is [jszwedko/go-circleci](https://github.com/jszwedko/go-circleci).

## Usage

## Roadmap

This library is being initially developed for use with the [CircleCI Terraform Provider](https://github.com/TomTucka/terraform-provider-circleci), so API methods will likely be implemented in the order that they are needed by that project.

## Contributing

I would like to cover the entire CircleCI v2 API and contributions are of course always welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
